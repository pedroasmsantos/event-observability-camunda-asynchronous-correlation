# Event-driven Microservices Observability With Camunda and Asynchronous Correlation Technique

This repository showcases a project developed under the scope of a master thesis on Software Engineering. It is a solution for attaining visibility and control over the business processes that span across multiple microservices on an event-driven microservices ecosystem. The workflow engine Camunda will be used with an implementation of a technique for correlating messages asynchronously.
